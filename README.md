# Server Stuff

This is a collection of useful scripts and such that I use for fast server setups.

nginx/setup.sh - Installs Nginx, php, and sets up Certbot for https
nginx/default - A custom file for SSL PHP setups - Commonly placed in /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
scripts/update.sh - A script to keep your server updated - Run daily
